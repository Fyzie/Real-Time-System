National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA)
NMEA has 2 main protocols:
a. NMEA 0183 is based on serial communication network. 
It is common standard to manage electronic system input and output connection. 
b. NMEA 2000 is controller area network (CAN) based technology.
It is designed as a single cable (backbone) replaces most of the NMEA 0183 wiring interconnections and can handle data content between 50 to 100 NMEA 0183 data streams.
