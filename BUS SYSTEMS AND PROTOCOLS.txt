BUS SYSTEMS AND PROTOCOLS
Modbus
Is a serial communication protocol and master-slave type protocol.
Has two types of Modbus frames which are Protocol Data Unit (PDU) containing function code and data, and Application Data Unit (ADU) containing additional address and error checking.
Data format:
Coil/Register
Numbers	Type	Table Name
1-9999	Read-Write	Discrete Output Coils
10001-19999	Read Only	Discrete Input Contacts
30001-39999	Read Only	Analog Input Registers
40001-49999	Read-Write	Analog Output Holding Registers

Modbus message speed: 9600 – 19200 baud rates.
Has three common Modbus which are Modbus ASCII, Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP/IP.

Modbus ASCII
Based on serial communication like RS485, RS422 and RS232.
RS232 - Communication of two devices less than 50 feet.
RS485/RS422 - Communication of two devices greater that 50 feet.
ASCII character to encode/decode a message.
Cannot communicate with RTU version.

Modbus RTU
Little variation from ASCII.
Based on serial communication.
Use bytes for messages.

Modbus TCP/IP
Based on Ethernet.
Contain Modbus packet within TCP/IP packet.
TCP/IP protocol for all messages.
Slow for Ethernet industrial protocols, fast for monitoring applications.
Advantages of Modbus:
Modbus is simple to implement.
Modbus is open protocol, so it does not require a specific media or physical layer.
The specification is available for free. and there are licensing fees. 
Provide Additional sample code, implementation examples, and diagnostics are available on the Modbus toolkit.
Suitable for small-to-medium volumes of data (<= 255 bytes).

Profibus
 A master-slave protocol and allows multiple master.

Profibus-DP (Decentralized Peripheral)
Physical layer: RS-485
Topology: Trunk with drops
Transmission rate (Speed): 9.6 K to 12 M bits/second
Advantages: Capable of handling time critical functions with high-speed data access.

Profibus-PA (Process Automation)
Physical layer: IEC 61158-2
Topology: Trunk with branching
Transmission rate (Speed): 31.25 Kbits/second
Developed to connect directly into Profibus-DP.

DeviceNet
CANbus - Protocol that runs over Controller Area Network (CAN)
Open Network Standard – specification and protocol are open while the specification can be obtained from Open DeviceNet Vendor Association Inc. (ODVA)
Two main purposes – 1) transport of control-oriented information associated with low-level devices and 2) transport of other information which is indirectly related to the system being controlled (configuration)
Transmission rate: 125k, 250k, 500k bit per second
Topology: Straight with restricted drops
Advantages of DeviceNet:
Increase design flexibility – provides unlimited I/O ports by providing network cascading and offers instrument interoperability and ‘Plug and Play’ capabilities
Improve process data management – affords Peer-to-Peer/ Master-Slave management

Foundation Fieldbus H1
Transmission rate: 31.25kbps

National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA)
NMEA has 2 main protocols:
a. NMEA 0183 is based on serial communication network. 
It is common standard to manage electronic system input and output connection. 
b. NMEA 2000 is controller area network (CAN) based technology.
It is designed as a single cable (backbone) replaces most of the NMEA 0183 wiring interconnections and can handle data content between 50 to 100 NMEA 0183 data streams.
